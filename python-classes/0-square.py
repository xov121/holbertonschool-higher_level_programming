This module defines the `Square` class.

The `Square` class is an empty class that defines a square. It serves as the
foundation for more complex behaviors that will be added in subsequent tasks.
This class is part of a project focused on learning object-oriented
programming (OOP) and understanding the basics of class creation, attributes,
methods, and encapsulation in Python.

Classes:

        or methods. It serves as a
    starting point for defining squares in later tasks.
